# DSF-PT08P4-PROJECT

## Introduction 
People from all walks of life can connect via movies. However, our personal tastes in movies still differ, ranging from concentrating on our favourite actors and directors to certain genres like romance, sci-fi, or thrillers. Although it's difficult to categorise movies that everyone would like, data scientists use behavioural patterns to find social groups with comparable movie tastes. As data scientists, we use machine learning to create a movie recommendation system by drawing insightful conclusions from audience behaviour and film characteristics.

Our project's objective is to create a model that, based on a user's assessments of previous movies, suggests the top five movies. By using the "classic" MovieLens dataset, which is widely utilised in scholarly research and proofs-of-concept for machine learning, we want to show the power of data-driven recommendations.

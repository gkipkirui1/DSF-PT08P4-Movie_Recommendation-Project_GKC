### 1. Project Overview
People from all walks of life can connect via movies. However, our personal tastes in movies still differ, ranging from concentrating on our favourite actors and directors to certain genres like romance, sci-fi, or thrillers. Although it's difficult to categorise movies that everyone would like, data scientists use behavioural patterns to find social groups with comparable movie tastes. As data scientists, we use machine learning to create a movie recommendation system by drawing insightful conclusions from audience behaviour and film characteristics.

My project's objective is to create a model that, based on a user's assessments of previous movies, suggests the top five movies. By using the "classic" MovieLens dataset, which is widely utilised in scholarly research and proofs-of-concept for machine learning, we want to show the power of data-driven recommendations.

### 4. Target Audience
The Target audience for this project are:
* xxx
    
### 5. Data
The data was sourced from https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/ and has files named links.csv, movies.csv, ratings.csv and tags.csv. 

### 6. Data Understanding
The data used for this project:
* Has xxx
* Has no Multicollinearity
* Has columns with Outliers

### 7. Data Pre_processing
The following processes were carried out to the training and test features before building the models:
* Iccxxx
* Split the resulting dataframe into train and test splits


### 8. Modelling
In this project, 4 Models were created:
1. SVD.....

### 9. Model Evaluation
The Models were evaluated on two parameters, XXX AND XXXX. Below are the outcomes of the evaluation for each Model
* Logistic Regression Model(Baseline) - Accuracy Score of 79% and AUC of 0.86
* Decision Tree Model(Tuned) - Accuracy score of 84% and AUC of 0.89
* Random Forest Model (Untuned) - Accuracy Score of 85% and AUC of 0.91
* Random Forest Model(Tuned) - Accuracy Score of 86% and  AUC of 0.92
